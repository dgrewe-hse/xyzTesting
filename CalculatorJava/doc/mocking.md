# Explanation Mock Testing

Mock testing (or simply mocking) is a technique used in unit testing to simulate the behavior of complex objects or external dependencies. These dependencies can be databases, APIs, web services, file systems, or any other component that might be difficult to incorporate directly into a unit test. Mocking allows you to isolate the component you’re testing (typically a class or function) by replacing real dependencies with “mock” versions that simulate their behavior in a controlled way.

In the `CalculatorMockitoTest` class, Mockito is used to mock the `LoggingService` to simulate its behavior without requiring a real implementation. Here’s a detailed explanation of what Mockito is doing in the test cases:

## What is Mockito?

Mockito is a popular Java framework used for mocking objects. Mocking allows you to create *“fake”* objects that simulate the behavior of real objects. This is particularly useful for testing, where you might not want to rely on the real implementations of dependencies like logging services, databases, or external APIs.

## Mockito in the `CalculatorMockitoTest` Class

In these test cases, the LoggingService is mocked because we are interested in testing the functionality of the Calculator class without depending on the real LoggingService implementation. We only care about verifying that logging is triggered at the right times, with the correct log messages.

## Key Concepts in Mockito Used in the Test Cases:

**Mocking the `LoggingService`**: In the `setUp()` method, Mockito creates a mock instance of `LoggingService`:

```bash
mockLoggingService = Mockito.mock(LoggingService.class);
```
This mock object will stand in for a real `LoggingService` implementation, allowing us to verify if it receives calls from the `Calculator` class.

**Injecting the Mock into `Calculator`**: In the `setUp()` method, Mockito creates a mock instance of `LoggingService`: The `Calculator` object is created using the mock `LoggingService`:

```bash
calculator = new Calculator(mockLoggingService);
```
By injecting the mock, we ensure that whenever the `Calculator` tries to log something, it will interact with the mock object instead of a real logging service.

**Verifying Method Calls with `verify()`:**: The `verify()` method is used to check whether a specific method was called on the mock object, and if it was called with the expected arguments. For example, in the `testAdd()` test case:

```bash
verify(mockLoggingService).log("Adding numbers: 1.0, 2.0, 3.0 = 6.0");
```

Here, Mockito verifies that the log() method on the mockLoggingService was called exactly once with the message "Adding numbers: 1.0, 2.0, 3.0 = 6.0". If this call didn’t happen, or if it was called with a different argument, the test would fail.

## Key Mockito Methods:

* `mock(Class<T> classToMock)`: Creates a mock object of the specified class (LoggingService in this case).
* `verify(T mock)`: Verifies that a method was called on the mock object.
* `verify(T mock).methodName(arg1, arg2, ...)`: Verifies that a specific method was called with particular arguments.

## Summary of Mockito’s Role in the Tests:

* Mockito is used to create a mock LoggingService that replaces the real service for testing purposes.
* It allows you to verify whether the Calculator class interacts correctly with the logging service.
* Mockito’s `verify()` method ensures that the `log()` method is called with the correct arguments, without needing an actual implementation of LoggingService.
* This approach isolates the behavior of the Calculator and makes the tests more focused and efficient.
